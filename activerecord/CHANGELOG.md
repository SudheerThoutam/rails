*   Coerce strings when reading attributes.
    Fixes #10485.

    Example:

        book = Book.new(title: 12345)
        book.save!
        book.title # => "12345"

*   Deprecate half-baked support for PostgreSQL range values with excluding beginnings.
    We currently map PostgreSQL ranges to Ruby ranges. This conversion is not fully
    possible because the Ruby range does not support excluded beginnings.

    The current solution of incrementing the beginning is not correct and is now
    deprecated. For subtypes where we don't know how to increment (e.g. `#succ`
    is not defined) it will raise an ArgumentException for ranges with excluding
    beginnings.

*   Support for user created range types in PostgreSQL.
